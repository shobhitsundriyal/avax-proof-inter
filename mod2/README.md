### steps to run this

- First thing to note is two contracts are deployed to avax testnet, use avax testnet in metamask as the network
- in the directory run `npm i`
- and then run `npm run dev`
- if you plan to deploy your own version, make the staking contract the owner of the erc20 contract
- then update the abi and contract address in 'contractDetails.js'
