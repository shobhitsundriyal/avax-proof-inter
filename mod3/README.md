# Hardhat Project

In this project I have created a erc20 token which can be found in `/contracts` folder

### steps to run
- Run `npm i`, which will install all the dependencies
- there are multiple test in test folder in TokenContract.ts, you can modify and write the testcases there.
- you can also spin up a local hardhat node and write new script or simply import contract to remix, connect with local node and test it out.
